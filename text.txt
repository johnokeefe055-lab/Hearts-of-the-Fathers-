  <!-- Introduction -->
  <section id="message" class="py-16 px-8 md:px-20 bg-white">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">A Call to Action</h2>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">
      When COVID struck, we learned something. When Charlie Kirk was murdered, we learned something else: 
      the Church of God cannot stay out of the public sphere. We cannot remain silent, fearing politics or ridicule.
      The gospel must leave the walls of the church and enter schools, governments, and communities.

  <!-- Ephesians Teaching -->
  <section class="py-16 px-8 md:px-20 bg-gray-50">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Rooted in Scripture</h2>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">
      The book of Ephesians reveals our identity, our mission, and our spiritual battle. From our calling as God’s workmanship 
      (Eph. 2:10) to declaring His wisdom to the powers in heavenly places (Eph. 3:10), Paul reminds us that we are in a war 
      against darkness—and we must put on the full armor of God.

  <!-- Cultural Engagement -->
  <section class="py-16 px-8 md:px-20 bg-white">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Engaging the Culture</h2>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">
      Like Paul in Ephesus, we confront idols and ideologies of our day. We cannot surrender our children, our schools, or our 
      governments to darkness. We must boldly declare: “No—you will not have our sons and daughters. No—you will not corrupt 
      our cities.” The Church belongs in the public square as salt and light.

  <!-- Call to Action -->
  <section class="py-16 px-8 md:px-20 bg-red-600 text-white text-center">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">The Time is Now</h2>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-8">
      We are called not to cowardice, but to courage. Not to silence, but to proclamation. The manifold wisdom of God must be declared—
      in homes, schools, governments, and streets. Let us rise, united, equipped, and unashamed of the gospel.
